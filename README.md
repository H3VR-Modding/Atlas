# Atlas
Atlas is the next generation of mapping tools for [Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Handgrenades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/450540/Hot_Dogs_Horseshoes__Hand_Grenades/).

## Features
- Occlusion Culling and Unity Enlighten support
- Access to all the game's components out of the box, no need for proxying
- Custom scripts created in the editor can be exported and included with your map as a plugin

## What about WurstMod?
These updates were originally planned for WurstMod but there quickly became too many structural changes. WurstMod maps are _not_ compatible with Atlas, and continuing with the WurstMod name could have implied there was some form of backwards compatibility when there isn't and never will be. The good news is that _Atlas is currently not incompatible with WurstMod_, that is to say you can run both of them side by side without issues.

For map authors; while it is possible to update your maps from WurstMod to Atlas, because of the major changes to the workflow it may be very difficult. It is not something I recommend doing unless you know what you're doing.

## How do I make a map?
There will be some guides available Soonâ„¢ for how to get an Atlas project setup and showcase the important bits of creating scenes specifically for H3VR. Past these basics creating scenes in Atlas is mostly just the regular Unity workflow, so if you are not familiar with using the Unity Editor then you will need to find external guides for that.

In the meantime, the sample project is available for you to download and use: https://github.com/H3VR-Modding/AtlasSampleProject
